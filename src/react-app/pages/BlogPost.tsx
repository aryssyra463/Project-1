      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The TOEFL Listening section can be challenging, and many students make common mistakes that cost them valuable points. Understanding these pitfalls can help you avoid them and improve your score significantly.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake #1: Not Taking Notes Effectively</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Many students either take too many notes or none at all. The key is to note main ideas, key terms, and relationships between concepts. Don't try to write everything down - focus on keywords and abbreviations.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake #2: Focusing on Every Word</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Trying to understand every single word leads to anxiety and missed information. Instead, focus on understanding the overall message and main points. Unknown words often become clear from context.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake #3: Ignoring Tone and Attitude</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">TOEFL often asks about speakers' attitudes or feelings. Pay attention to tone of voice, emphasis, and expressions that indicate opinion or emotion.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake #4: Not Previewing Questions</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Use the brief time before each section to read the questions. This helps you know what to listen for and makes note-taking more targeted.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Mistake #5: Dwelling on Missed Information</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">If you miss something, don't panic. Keep listening and move on. Dwelling on missed information causes you to miss even more.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to Improve</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Practice with authentic TOEFL listening materials daily</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Listen to academic lectures and podcasts</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Develop your own note-taking system</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Practice under timed conditions</li>
      </ul>

    content: `
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Vocabulary Matters for GRE</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">A strong vocabulary is essential for GRE success. The Verbal Reasoning section tests your ability to understand complex texts and use words precisely. Building vocabulary takes time, but with the right strategies, you can accelerate your learning.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Strategy 1: Learn Words in Context</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Don't just memorize definitions. Read words in sentences and passages to understand how they're used. This helps with retention and application during the test.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Strategy 2: Use Spaced Repetition</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Apps like Anki or Quizlet use spaced repetition algorithms to help you review words at optimal intervals. This method significantly improves long-term retention.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Strategy 3: Group Words by Theme</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Learn related words together: synonyms, antonyms, and words with similar roots. This creates mental connections that aid recall.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Strategy 4: Learn Word Roots</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Understanding Latin and Greek roots helps you decode unfamiliar words. For example, knowing "bene" means "good" helps you understand benevolent, beneficial, and benediction.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Essential Word Lists</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Start with high-frequency GRE words (about 500-1000 words)</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Focus on words you encounter in practice tests</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Learn 10-20 new words daily</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Review previously learned words regularly</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding PTE Speaking</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The PTE Speaking section is computer-scored, which means clarity, fluency, and pronunciation are evaluated by algorithms. Understanding how the scoring works can help you maximize your score.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Read Aloud Tips</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Speak clearly at a natural pace. Don't rush or speak too slowly. Pay attention to punctuation for natural pauses. Practice chunking sentences into meaningful phrases.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Repeat Sentence Strategies</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Focus on the first and last words of the sentence. Don't worry about getting every word perfect - maintain fluency even if you miss a word. Say something rather than staying silent.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Describe Image Techniques</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Use a template: Introduction, key features, trends/comparisons, conclusion. Speak for the full 40 seconds. Use varied vocabulary and connectors.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Re-tell Lecture Tips</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Take notes during the lecture focusing on main points. Use templates to organize your response. Include key terms from the lecture.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Time Management Matters</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Effective time management can make the difference between a good score and a great one. Many test-takers know the material but run out of time or rush through questions. Here's how to manage your time effectively.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Before the Test</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Know the test format and time limits for each section</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Practice with timed conditions regularly</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Develop a pacing strategy for each section</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Get adequate sleep the night before</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">During the Test</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Start with questions you find easier to build confidence. Don't spend too much time on any single question - mark it and move on. Keep track of time but don't obsess over it.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Section-Specific Strategies</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed"><strong>Reading:</strong> Skim passages first, then answer questions. Don't re-read entire passages for each question.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed"><strong>Writing:</strong> Spend 5 minutes planning before writing. Leave 5 minutes for review at the end.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed"><strong>Listening:</strong> Stay focused throughout - you can't pause or replay audio.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">The 2-Minute Rule</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">If you've spent more than 2 minutes on a question without progress, make your best guess and move on. You can return to it if time permits.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Foundation of Great Essays</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Whether you're taking IELTS, TOEFL, or GRE, the principles of good essay writing remain consistent. A well-structured essay with clear arguments will always score higher than a disorganized one.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Analyze the Prompt</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Spend 2-3 minutes understanding exactly what the question asks. Identify keywords and the type of essay required (argumentative, discussion, problem-solution).</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Plan Your Response</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Create a brief outline with your main points and examples. Planning prevents writer's block and ensures logical flow.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Write a Strong Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Hook the reader, provide context, and state your thesis clearly. Your introduction sets the tone for the entire essay.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Develop Body Paragraphs</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Each paragraph should have: Topic sentence, explanation, example, and link back to thesis. Use transition words to connect ideas.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 5: Conclude Effectively</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Summarize main points and restate your thesis in different words. End with a final thought or call to action.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Going off-topic</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Using informal language</li>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">TOEFL Reading passages are academic in nature, covering topics from various fields like science, history, and social sciences. Each passage is 600-700 words with 10 questions.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Active Reading Strategy</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Don't read passively. Engage with the text: identify the main idea of each paragraph, note how ideas connect, and pay attention to transition words that signal relationships.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Question Types</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">

        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Detail:</strong> Scan for specific information</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Inference:</strong> Draw conclusions from stated information</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Summary:</strong> Identify main ideas vs. minor details</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">You have about 20 minutes per passage. Spend 3-4 minutes reading, then 1-2 minutes per question. Don't spend too long on difficult questions - mark and return if time permits.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Practice Tips</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Read academic articles from sources like Scientific American, The Economist, and university websites. This builds familiarity with academic vocabulary and writing styles.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">The GRE Analytical Writing Assessment has two tasks: Analyze an Issue (30 min) and Analyze an Argument (30 min). Each is scored 0-6. A score of 5+ demonstrates strong critical thinking and writing skills.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Issue Essay Strategy</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Take a clear position and defend it with specific examples. Acknowledge counterarguments but explain why your position is stronger. Aim for 4-5 paragraphs.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Argument Essay Strategy</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Identify logical flaws in the given argument: unsupported assumptions, weak evidence, logical fallacies. Don't give your opinion on the topic - analyze the reasoning.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Read Aloud is the first speaking task in PTE and contributes to both reading and speaking scores. It's your chance to make a strong first impression with clear, fluent speech.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Pronunciation Tips</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Focus on word stress - English words have stressed syllables</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Pay attention to vowel sounds - they differ between accents</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Practice difficult consonant clusters</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Don't add extra sounds between words</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Fluency Strategies</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Read in meaningful chunks, not word by word. Use punctuation to guide pauses. Maintain a steady pace - not too fast, not too slow. If you stumble, continue smoothly without repeating.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Practice Method</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Record yourself reading various texts. Compare with native speakers. Use text-to-speech tools to hear correct pronunciation. Practice daily with news articles and academic texts.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Common Mistakes</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Avoid: speaking too fast, ignoring punctuation, mispronouncing common words, monotone delivery, and long pauses.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Motivation Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Test preparation can be a long journey, and maintaining motivation is crucial for success. Many students start strong but lose momentum over time. Here's how to stay motivated throughout your preparation.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Set Clear Goals</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Define your target score and why you need it. Write down your goals and review them regularly. Break large goals into smaller, achievable milestones.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Create a Study Routine</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Consistency beats intensity. Study at the same time each day to build a habit. Even 30 minutes daily is better than irregular long sessions.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Track Your Progress</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Take regular practice tests to measure improvement</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Keep a study journal</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Celebrate small wins</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Review how far you've come, not just how far you have to go</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Handle Setbacks</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Bad days are normal. Don't let one poor practice test derail you. Learn from mistakes rather than dwelling on them. Take short breaks when needed, but always return.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Find Support</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Join study groups or online communities. Share your goals with friends and family. Consider working with a tutor or mentor for accountability.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Schedule Matters</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">A well-designed study schedule helps you cover all material systematically, prevents last-minute cramming, and reduces stress. It turns vague intentions into concrete actions.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 1: Assess Your Time</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Calculate how many weeks until your test date. Determine how many hours per day/week you can realistically study. Be honest about your other commitments.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 2: Identify Priorities</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Take a diagnostic test to identify weak areas. Allocate more time to challenging sections while maintaining skills in stronger areas.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 3: Create the Schedule</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Block specific times for study each day</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Alternate between different skills/sections</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Include regular practice tests</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Schedule breaks and rest days</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Step 4: Stay Flexible</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Review and adjust your schedule weekly based on progress. If something isn't working, change it. The best schedule is one you can actually follow.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Sample Weekly Plan</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Monday: Reading practice | Tuesday: Listening practice | Wednesday: Writing practice | Thursday: Speaking practice | Friday: Mixed practice | Saturday: Full practice test | Sunday: Review and rest</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Test Anxiety</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Test anxiety is common and can significantly impact performance. Physical symptoms include rapid heartbeat, sweating, and nausea. Mental symptoms include blanking out and negative thoughts. The good news: it's manageable.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Before the Test</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Prepare thoroughly - confidence comes from preparation</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Simulate test conditions during practice</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Get adequate sleep the night before</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Avoid caffeine if it increases your anxiety</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Arrive early to settle in</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Breathing Techniques</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Practice deep breathing: inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts. This activates your parasympathetic nervous system and reduces stress hormones.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">During the Test</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">If anxiety strikes: pause, take deep breaths, and refocus. Start with easier questions to build confidence. Remember that some anxiety is normal and can even improve focus.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Positive Self-Talk</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Instead of "I'll fail," think "I've prepared well and I can do this." Visualize success before and during the test.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Balance Challenge</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Test-takers often struggle to balance reading speed with comprehension accuracy. Reading too fast leads to missed details; reading too slowly means running out of time. Finding the right balance is key.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Improving Reading Speed</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Reduce subvocalization (reading aloud in your head)</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Use your finger or a pointer to guide your eyes</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Expand your peripheral vision to read word groups</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Practice speed reading exercises daily</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Maintaining Accuracy</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li class="mb-2">Preview headings and structure before reading</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Identify the main idea of each paragraph</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Note key terms and their definitions</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Pay attention to transition words</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Strategic Reading for Tests</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">You don't need to read every word with equal attention. Skim for main ideas first, then read more carefully when answering specific questions. Let the questions guide your reading.</p>
      
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-900 mt-8 mb-4">Practice Approach</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">Start by focusing on accuracy, then gradually increase speed. Track both your reading time and comprehension scores. Aim for at least 70% accuracy before pushing for more speed.</p>
